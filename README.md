(1)Transfer function can only be initiated by contract owner(2)Some way to replace variables to be inserted (i.e. TOKEN name, total token supply etc) before contract creation (Since there are likely multiple startups on our platform)(3)Burn function (If not found, Only by contract owner) -> return the money to the token holder(%) then burn token to cancel contract if startup fails etc |        | (1)The corresponding function is the TransferFrom function which is removed(2)Add CodeIsContractOwner checks for existing functions; previously procedures and transitions checked for different users(3)Already implemented in template smart contract.(4)Should burn function be implemented by sending it to trash address? |

## [Outdated] Flow for fungible token 
1.	smart_contract_owner needs to IncreaseAllowance() + Transfer()
2.	For secondary market market scenario 1: token holder -> secondary market recipient, smart_contract_owner needs to IncreaseAllowance()  +  tokenholder needs to TransferFrom() where the from is the address of smart_contract_owner
3.	For secondary market market scenario 2: secondary market recipient -> secondary market recipient, smart_contract_owner needs to IncreaseAllowance()  +  tokenholder needs to TransferFrom() where the from is the address of smart_contract_owner
